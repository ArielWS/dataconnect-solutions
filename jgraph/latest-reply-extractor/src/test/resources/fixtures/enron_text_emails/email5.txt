Jim - this is what we discussed in Houston last week, i.e., a proposal for a
market in Japan.  Any thoughts would be appreciated, I am sure, by Mark
Crowther and Nick O'Day.   thanks  mcs

Subject: new draft



Mark: please find attached the new draft. As we  discussed this morning, we
still need to add some details (cites etc) that you  will send us, and also
add additional local examples which you will  identify.
?
I would like to spend a few more hours going over  the appendices, so will
send them to you on Monday. Look forward to getting your  thoughts, and
hopefully to seeing you over here in April.
Regards,
Boaz
