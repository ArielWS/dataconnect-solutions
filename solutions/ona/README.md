11. Use this link to initiate the setup of the pre-requisites. Use the appid and secret created in the 
previous steps. Custom deployment - Microsoft Azure [here](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmicrosoftgraph%2Fdataconnect-solutions%2Fmain%2Fsolutions%2Fona%2FARMTemplate%2Fazuredeploy.json?token=AATN3TJ6UQWU7TFMZ2R6ZW3ASL5JQ)

The link above sets up the pre-requisites to using the information oversharing template, which are:

- Create a Synapse Workspace
- Create a Spark Pool for the Synapse workspace
- Create a storage account for the extracted data
- Grant permission to the Synapse workspace & the MGDC Service Principal to the storage account as Blob Data Contributor

By clicking on the above button (or navigating to the linked URL), users will be brought to the Azure portal on the Custom deployment page.

On that screen, on top of providing information about the resource group and region to deploy the components into, they will need to provide the following information:

- Application Id to be used by MGDC (from step #3, ending in 9826)
- Application secret for that app

Once all required information has been provided, click on the Review + create button at the bottom of the page:
