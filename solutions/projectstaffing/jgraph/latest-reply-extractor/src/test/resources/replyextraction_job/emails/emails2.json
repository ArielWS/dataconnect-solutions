The land is selling for $2.50 per square\nfoot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West\nSan Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.\n\nSeveral new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes\nand for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25\nper square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and\n$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  This\nproperty will have the best location for student housing of all new\nprojects, just as the duplexes do now.\n\nIf this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there\nis a very, very short window of opportunity.

It appears that a single \nbuyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above \nmarket prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas.  At the time of these trades, \noffers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were \nbypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index \ncalculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated \nfinancial swaps for San Juan.\n\n We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from \nSeptember 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from \nEnron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage \nfirms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a \ntrade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas \ndaily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread \nrelationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows:\n\n 1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater \nthan the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. \n\n 2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & \nNorthwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and \n       October gas daily.  It doesn't make sense to have monthly indices that \nare dramatically different.\n\n\n I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the \ntrades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to \ndetermine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are \noutliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in \nestablishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron's belief that the trades at \n$4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the \ncalculation of index.\n\n It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indices against which to \nconduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact me \nanytime I can assist you towards this goal.\n\nSincerely,\n\nPhillip Allen"},"Sender":{"EmailAddress":{"Name":"Phillip K Allen","Address":"phillip.allen@enron.com"}},"From":{"EmailAddress":{"Name":"Phillip K Allen","Address":"phillip.allen@enron.com"}},"ToRecipients":[{"EmailAddress":{"Name":"Lkuch@mh.com","Address":"lkuch@mh.com"}}],"CcRecipients":[{"EmailAddress":{"Name":"","Address":""}}],"BccRecipients":[{"EmailAddress":{"Name":"","Address":""}}],"ReplyTo":[],"ODataType":"#Microsoft.OutlookServices.Message","puser":"","ptenant":"","pAdditionalInfo":"","rowinformation":{"errorInformation":""}}
